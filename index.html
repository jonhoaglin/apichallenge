      <h1>Welcome to my first REST API!</h1>

      <p>This is a response to a coding challenge to write an API endpoint using any language of my choice.
      The challenge was to create an API endpoint to serve some information from github.</p>

      <p>I chose Javascript/Node.js, as an opportunity to also learn Node.
      This project makes use of Express.js to simplify the API creation,
      and sync-request to pull information from the github API.</p>

      <p>I am using basic authentication to increase the rate limit to the github API.
      As tokens are automatically flagged and disabled when uploaded to github,
      you will need to create a token.js file in the root folder and fill it with your
      own token like so:</p>

          <p>
            <code>
              var token = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';<br />
              exports.token = token;
            </code>
          </p>

      <h2>=== USAGE ===</h2>

      <p>To run, first install dependencies with:<code>npm install</code><br/>
        then use command: <code>node app.js</code>
      </p>

      <p>There are 2 main methods
        <ol>
          <li>/followers/:id<br />
            Will accept a github id/username, and return up to 5 followers,
            then recursively retrieves the followers for each, up to 3 levels deep.</li>

        <li>/repos/:id<br />
            Will accept a github id/username, and return up to 3 repositories for that user,
            along with up to 3 stargazers for each.
            Also recurses to retrieve the repositories for each stargazer, up to 3 levels deep.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
